* Abstract

* Introduction

* Preliminary implementation
A preliminary implementation of the somewhat homomorphic encryption
scheme (SHE) described in Gentry's original thesis[1] in Haskell.

* DSL Design
When designing the DSL a high-level design was ...

Inspired by Cryptol with type-level naturals[2]

: split : {a b c} [a*b]c -> [a][b]c

: KeyExpansion_128 : [4][32] -> [11][4][4][8];
: KeyExpansion_128 keyAsWords = [| transpose s || s <- ss ]]
:   where {
:     ss = groupBy(4, [| reverse (splitBy(4, w)) || w <- ws |]);
:     ws = keyAsWords # ([| nextWord_128(i, w, w')
:                        || i  <- [4..43]
:                        || w  <- ws
:                        || w' <- drop(3, ws)
:                        |]);
:   };
