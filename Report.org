* Abstract

* Introduction

* Preliminary implementation
A preliminary implementation of the somewhat homomorphic encryption
scheme (SHE) described in Gentry's original thesis[1] in Haskell.

* DSL Design
When designing the DSL a high-level design was ...

Inspired by Cryptol with type-level naturals[2]

: split : {a b c} [a*b]c -> [a][b]c
