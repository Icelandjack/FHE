A domain specific language (DSL) is one 

A domain specific language is one that is customize

problem domain. Unlike DSLs, general purpose langua
ges (GPLs) are not designed for a specific
domain and it is often difficult to express concept
s of a domain in a GPL. A DSL is specialized
for one type of specifications and provides a small
comprehensive syntax for users. DSLs allow
specification of aspects quickly and easily by prov
iding a more expressive and less complex
language interface [4]. The idea behind DSLs is to
make a simpler and easier platform for the
domain experts so that they can free themselves fro
m the details of any general purpose
programming language and can specify and verify the
ir implementations using a simplified set of
abstractions [10]. DSLs are generally easier to lea
rn and less ambiguous to understand even for
non-programmers. Generally a domain expert is not a
